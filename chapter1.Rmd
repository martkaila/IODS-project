*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*


It is a brilliant opportunity to take this course. I'm especially looking forward to learning how to utilize R and GitHub efficiently in my research process. 
I found the course through the Weboodi course catalog that lists mandatory interdisciplinary Ph.D. courses.
